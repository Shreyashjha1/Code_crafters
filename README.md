In the modern recruitment process, organizations increasingly rely on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes automatically. As a result, many resumes are rejected at an early stage due to skill mismatches, missing keywords, or improper resume structure, even when candidates possess relevant potential. Job seekers often lack awareness of whether their resumes are suitable for specific job roles and receive little to no feedback explaining the reasons for rejection.

Additionally, candidates are unable to identify the skills they need to acquire or highlight in order to improve their job suitability. On the recruiter’s side, manually reviewing and filtering a large volume of resumes is time-consuming and inefficient. These challenges create a gap between job seekers and recruiters, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient hiring processes.
Objectives
The primary objective of the AI-Based Resume Analyzer & Job Matching System is to automate the resume screening process by extracting and analyzing key candidate information using NLP and machine learning techniques.
It aims to compute accurate match scores between resumes and job descriptions, rank candidates effectively, and provide actionable insights to improve recruitment efficiency for employers and job fit for candidates.
Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-Based Resume Analyzer & Job Matching System that automates the entire resume screening and candidate ranking process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system parses uploaded resumes (PDF/DOCX) to extract structured information such as personal details, education, work experience, skills, and achievements, followed by intelligent matching against job descriptions through TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity scoring. It generates a precise compatibility percentage, ranks candidates in descending order of match score, highlights matched/missing skills, and provides actionable feedback to job seekers while enabling recruiters to efficiently shortlist top talent, thereby significantly reducing manual effort, minimizing bias, and improving overall hiring accuracy and speed.
